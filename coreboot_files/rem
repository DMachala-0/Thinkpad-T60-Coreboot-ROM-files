T60(x1400 128MB)
    -> src/northbridge/intel/i945/raminit.c -> DEFAULT_PCI_MMIO_SIZE -> 512
	-> src/mainboard/lenovo/t60/devicetree.cb -> register "pci_mmio_size" = "512"

T60p(v5250 256MB)
	 -> no change in code
     -> 3.2G only

vgabios extract 
	-> with each display change load original bios and read vga bios rom
	-> rom is unable to 'switch' between single channel and dual channel LVDS communication
	(seabios is able but linux is not)(same for T60,T60p)
	
Problem with sata connection lockup after long/random IO ops (this is due to linux changes in drivers , kernel 5.xx+ affected, but 4.3,4.19 unaffected)

useful command, use with stock bios, when reconfigured VGA BIOS is needed for diffrent LCD display

linux:

cat /proc/iomem | grep 'Video ROM' | (read m; m=${m/ :*}; s=${m/-*}; e=${m/*-}; \
dd if=/dev/mem of=vgabios.bin bs=1c skip=$[0x$s] count=$[$[0x$e]-$[0x$s]+1])

flashrom:

flashrom -p serprog:dev=/dev/ttyACM0:4000000 -c MX25L1605 -w build/coreboot.rom
